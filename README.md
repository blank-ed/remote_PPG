# Remote Photoplethysmography
This is my implementations of rPPG algorithms. **_This is still a work in progress_**.

The main purpose of this repository is to recreate the frameworks of all the state-of-the-art rPPG methods. Based on my research on this, I have found that there is an interdependency between the stages of rPPG. Therefore, in order to get a meaningful comparison with their frameworks, it is imperitive that every stage remains the same. 

Finished implementing ICA rPPG [link](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-18-10-10762&id=199381)

Currently working on PCA rPPG
